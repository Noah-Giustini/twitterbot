22523896,FairVoteCanada,1451284213840453639,@ChrisAikman2 @StevenDelDuca Both STV and MMP maintain local representation, and we've favoured an open list model for a while where voters would still vote directly for a candidate.


22523896,FairVoteCanada,1451271051753701381,@BerlinskyJohn @OhSheri1 Whether it's 35% or 52% there's no way one person can represent all the diverse views in a riding.

We think Liberal voters in a Conservative seat should be just as entitled to representation as Conservative voters in a Liberal seat.


22523896,FairVoteCanada,1451270544758910981,@mmorgenthau Simply put, referendums are just a bad way of deciding policy and can be easily derailed by partisanship and misinformation.

It's very telling the same people who use the referendum excuse are also saying ranked ballots shouldn't be put to a vote. https://t.co/YHQp2qYfHP


22523896,FairVoteCanada,1451263017677623299,@BerlinskyJohn @OhSheri1 But you know they don't? Doug Ford was elected in his riding with 52% of the vote.

Do you think he's representing the views of the Liberal or NDP voters in his riding?


22523896,FairVoteCanada,1451254459703730188,@BerlinskyJohn @OhSheri1 But the end result is still "one-riding, one-winner".

If a candidate wins a seat with 50%+1, shouldn't the other 49% also get representation?

22523896,FairVoteCanada,1451242958557171714,@robertbenzie @reggcohn Every time electoral reform has been studied provincially and federally, proportional representation has always been the recommendation.

Ranked ballots can easily be used in PR systems, but on their own can lead to wildly disproportionate results. https://t.co/glV18Jl9p3

109144163,TransportAction,1451973495701786632,@OmarAlghabra @Transport_gc if Alberta's future economy is going to be as strong as its past oil-based economy was then "equalization" of passenger rail service is necessary, ending 30 years of getting the short end of the deal on sustainable mobility. https://t.co/px6GGe3XY7


109144163,TransportAction,1451972429555945478,@VIA_Rail Not over any distance where the train is a realistic choice and there's reasonable local transit or car rental at the other end.


109144163,TransportAction,1451971615420567558,@ClintonDesveaux @AlexanderGlista Many European networks are shared, including some of Germany's high speed lines. There's a win-win in shared infrastructure that offers improved environmentally sound freight logistics too. Sometimes dedicated track is worth the extra dollars, but not always.

109144163,TransportAction,1451556224424685569,@SecretaryPete Ensuring plenty of charging at @Amtrak stations would help, because EVs are still traffic and highway building is still fantastically carbon intensive.

The way to avoid strikes in any industry is to have fair pay and decent working conditions, including no arbitrary cuts.


109144163,TransportAction,1451551402799640581,Manitoba's new Premier, Hon. Kelvin Goertzen, took the train from Thompson to Churchill and back, which may explain some of the extra equipment. Sleeper class reservations have not re-opened on this route yet, hopefully soon.

109144163,TransportAction,1450908439778107392,@Prodriversltd You've got it... if the 413 becomes and excuse to start building on the #greenbelt, the chances of any of that housing being affordable are even worse than the chances of a new highway actually doing anything to reduce congestion.


109144163,TransportAction,1450906836966776832,@MatthewPeloza Until the Mulroney cuts in 1990, there was a VIA train on the route, plus the connection from Senneterre through to Cochrane.


109144163,TransportAction,1450901799251087364,The Ontario PC Party promised at the last election to get this done in their current term of office, there's no need to keep northern Ontario waiting into the "mid 2020s" for the return of passenger train service. https://t.co/z1qdV2Vvgg


109144163,TransportAction,1450851848685072394,@RailAlberta As long as it can be done in a way that works for @CanadianPacific such as charging points on sidings and station tracks clear of their main lines, then it would be an option. Stadler also offer a Hydrogen version of this train.


109144163,TransportAction,1450838117481652232,@Prodriversltd There's already a highway that does that: 407 - it would be cheaper and better to reduce truck tolls on 407 than build a new highway that would provide a less direct route to Brampton Intermodal and other hubs.


109144163,TransportAction,1450831702100688896,More battery-electric innovation. This is the much same train that's to be used on the extended Ottawa Trillium Line, only without the diesel genset in the middle.

109144163,TransportAction,1450455246782746630,@PaulLangan5 Plus, the #1 action item we've been calling for in SWO is to get the track fixed between London and Kitchener. Adding this train before doing that work doesn't serve the region well, hence negative media coverage focusing on the 4h trip time.


109144163,TransportAction,1450452995574018051,@PaulLangan5 We also support the restoration of the Ontario Northland train service, and wonder why Doug Ford rushed to duplicate the London service rather than keeping his promise to get the Northlander running before 2022?


109144163,TransportAction,1450451764633903104,@PaulLangan5 We support commuter services like GO, EXO and WCE. What we don't support is duplication of effort and lack of coordination between agencies and levels of government. If there's a coordinated shift of the NML to GO, VIA can run Sarnia trains through Brantford, that's fine with us.

109144163,TransportAction,1450219173800513542,@MatthewPeloza @JeffreyBeeler @ryanphanna It becomes a win if the redeployed VIA equipment is used to restore more services between London and Sarnia.


109144163,TransportAction,1450204535838941186,@MatthewPeloza @JeffreyBeeler @ryanphanna That's one possible outcome if both levels of government take a coordinated approach. Splitting and combining trains at Kitchener and using new GO equipment designed for passenger comfort on the longer London and Niagara routes would be welcome in that scenario.


109144163,TransportAction,1450192495661436932,@JeffreyBeeler @ryanphanna @MatthewPeloza This is an almost entirely parallel service, two levels of government tripping over each other rather than working together. GO's expected subsidy per passenger, based on their ridership projections, is at least three times higher than VIA's was in 2019.


109144163,TransportAction,1450190406776406027,@douglasyardley @PickelPressCTV @GOtransit @CTVKitchener The track between London and Kitchener would need to be restored to allow the use of a heavier locomotive or to go faster than ~30 mph.


109144163,TransportAction,1450189917737439239,@thecleaninguy @GOtransit The federal requirement will apply to VIA (federal) but not to GO (provincial) even where the two operate parallel services.

109144163,TransportAction,1450119787649150979,@MatthewPeloza @JeffreyBeeler @ryanphanna Hopefully that means a 575V shore power connection has been provided. There were two 480V connections, installed so VIA trains wouldn't have to idle overnight.


109144163,TransportAction,1450118212931178496,@JeffreyBeeler @ryanphanna @MatthewPeloza The federal cuts came first, under Mulroney and then Harper. GO stepped into the vacuum between Kitchener and Toronto with funding initially from the Ontario Liberals, but that caused a drastic drop in ridership on VIA 84/47 except on weekends.


109144163,TransportAction,1450117264292864008,@JeffreyBeeler @ryanphanna @MatthewPeloza Extremely good question, especially if one asks why they're deadheading a whole GO consist west from Kitchener in the early hours and back again late at night. It would be so much easier to hold federal feet to the fire and/or co-fund VIA frequency.


109144163,TransportAction,1450115994479906818,@JeffreyBeeler @ryanphanna @MatthewPeloza That's been the case for a decade, which is why its been so hard to fight for the restoration of the second Sarnia train. Before Stephen Harper's 2012 cuts, VIA had plans to expand London-Kitchener-Toronto service considerably, because the travel demand has been there all along.


109144163,TransportAction,1450115282312351746,@ryanphanna @MatthewPeloza @JeffreyBeeler GO is commuter, VIA is intercity, and regional service like Kitchener to London is sorely neglected, but such routes are a probably better fit for a three-coach VIA train than a 10 or 12 bilevel GO consist, and are really a federal responsibility.


109144163,TransportAction,1450113767837159425,@ryanphanna @MatthewPeloza The irony is that the same Conservatives who claimed ~100 passengers was too few for a short VIA train are now apparently fine with extremely low ridership on a full-length GO train. GO is ultimately as vulnerable to "austerity" as VIA, perhaps more so if running 1000 empty seats


109144163,TransportAction,1450106383643385857,Londoners want VIA speeds and comfort at GO prices and more frequently. That's possible, with joint federal-provincial investment in SW Ontario, but the key is it has to be a joint effort and business model, not GO competing for the same passengers as VIA. https://t.co/ho7LulWGzl


109144163,TransportAction,1450099486500458505,@MatthewPeloza It would be even better if VIA 86/89 had been reinstated and 85/88 extended back to Sarnia!


109144163,TransportAction,1450097968409948160,@C_Mulroney @GOtransit Better than nothing, but sending a GO train to compete with VIA doesn't seem like the collaborative approach heralded in the draft regional transportation plan. Restoring the VIA services cut in 2012 would be less costly, and include restoring Sarnia to at least two trains daily.


109144163,TransportAction,1450092574375649285,@VIA_Rail So many things we would love "it" to be... Daily Ocean? Canadian through Thunder Bay and Regina? Calgary-Edmonton? Halifax-Sydney? Victoria-Courtenay? North Vancouver to Prince George? Canada needs them all back!


109144163,TransportAction,1450089156659527683,@TAAGuelph This would be a huge step forward. The lack of public transport options between Brantford/Hamilton and Kitchener/Guelph without going into Mississauga and back out is an absurdity.


109144163,TransportAction,1450088484472074240,Not a good start to GO's new service.

109144163,TransportAction,1448061565023002628,@AvroInterceptor We'd take good state of repair and track speeds of more than 50 km/h for starters.

109144163,TransportAction,1443294332992335874,@theroadhogmain8 Correct, although baggage and bicycle space on board is increased. There will be a mix of 3, 4, 5 and 7 car formations to provide some flexibility.


109144163,TransportAction,1443293649392046081,@theroadhogmain8 The full fleet of 32 sets will be enough to run all services in the 2019 corridor schedule plus a few more.

To see it talked about as "cheaper" is frustrating.
So too is the pervasive message that 1000s of #LTC residents could be served adequately in home care

80471236,OntarioHealthC,1451222711158591495,@kimmcdt Home care is not cheaper if the care is equivalent. It's only cheaper bc ppl get so few hours of care. Also the workers are paid less (but there's a HUGE markup for the  4profit home care corps).
The staffing crisis in home care  means care often doesn't materialize at all.

80471236,OntarioHealthC,1449161737052229633,@Lilipuddlian Ontario is different. The for-profit homes are run under licenses. The Minister has had the power to fine them, suspend licenses &amp; revoke licenses in the public interest. They haven't done so. Further, the licenses end.

Yes, they are buying them out. Hopefully there'll be public accountability about how that deal happens. No, it doesn't appear to be driven by Extendicare. It's driven by the Sask Health Authority which found problems with the company


80471236,OntarioHealthC,1448820477443649536,According to the ombudsman report, during the fatal outbreak, health officials left a¬†Dec. 2020¬†meeting¬†with Extendicare concerned¬†that the co's¬†"corporate leaders were taking an arm's length approach &amp; were providing only minimal corporate support to its local staff." 
End.


80471236,OntarioHealthC,1448820476298604548,The Saskatchwan Health Authority apologized for what it called a tragedy. NB. Many more people died in Ontario's Extendicare homes &amp; nothing has happened.

Still, they are getting rid of Extendicare &amp; instating public control over the homes.

11/13


47452040,OpenMediaOrg,1440389169025486854,But there‚Äôs zero good faith in the government‚Äôs approach. This proposal is an unprecedented surveillance power grab for law enforcement first, and a thoughtless proposal that represses much lawful speech second. 

The needs and rights of Canadian users take a back seat. 10/13


47452040,OpenMediaOrg,1440389165481226245,There‚Äôs room for good faith disagreement on how to balance trade-offs around rules for online speech, and who should set them. In Canada, scholars like @EmilyLaidlaw, @mckelveyf, @lex_is, @cyn_K and @mgeist have nuanced and diverse views on how to approach the problem. 9/13


47452040,OpenMediaOrg,1440389161542774784,Similarly, mass reporting of online speech to the RCMP will lead directly to even more over-policing of marginalized folk. 

Mass surveillance is unsafe for all of us. But it places people already disproportionately targeted by law enforcement at the most risk.
8/13


47452040,OpenMediaOrg,1440389159395348485,Forcing platforms to censor as quickly as they can will produce inflexible rules with limited human oversight. 

Who will this approach turbo-charge the most? Hateful online troll brigades that already abuse existing takedown rules to attack marginalized communities. 7/13


47452040,OpenMediaOrg,1440389155951820809,The government is selling their censorship plan as THE solution to addressing hate online. 

Make no mistake: online hate is a real problem, and platforms must do better by its victims. But as written, this proposal does more harm than good. 6/13


47452040,OpenMediaOrg,1440389152596389892,What will the RCMP do with a wide record of who‚Äôs talking about the next protest? We don‚Äôt know. But their shameful history of surveilling &amp; over-policing Canada‚Äôs climate movement and Indigenous activism suggests nothing good.

47452040,OpenMediaOrg,1440389149073166340,Here‚Äôs the worst part: our legal, legitimate posts won‚Äôt just be removed from social media. They‚Äôll be automatically reported DIRECTLY to CSIS &amp; the RCMP. 

That means a growing surveillance record with law enforcement for every person in Canada who has a post removed. 4/13


47452040,OpenMediaOrg,1440389147076673546,What kind of perfectly legal posts will likely get caught up in this censorship?

- Support for or participation in protests;
- Documentation of horrific human rights abuses;
- Humour/satire;
- Consensual sexual expression;
- Art/activism by marginalized folks. 3/13


47452040,OpenMediaOrg,1440389143293427713,The plan would force platforms like Facebook and Twitter to proactively surveil our posts for illegal content, removing anything that could qualify within 24 hrs.

Alex Tavasoli: The way the election turned out.
@KehkashanBasu : The empathy people are demonstrating in the pandemic.
@ThatHeatherC: Creativity, ingenuity, innovation, hard work.


24913022,Pembina,1443265870399033344,An empathy-based approach to climate engagement where "you recognize someone else's problems as your own" will support a faster and more just #EnergyTransition says @KehkashanBasu.


24913022,Pembina,1443265492127342592,@ThatHeatherC @GLOBE_Series "When we're doing engagement, are we hearing people or are we actually listening?" asks @j_rdynburnouf.

She says listening and putting what is heard into action will empower people to engage more with the #EnergyTransition. https://t.co/9xqEfWuhVu


24913022,Pembina,1443264756127703042,"We need to change our metrics," says @ThatHeatherC. She says people want to understand the impact of the #EnergyTransition on themselves and their daily lives, so providing metrics that people can relate to can help them connect more. https://t.co/Te6ljspHpm


24913022,Pembina,1443264323095195649,What does effective engagement on energy transformation look like?

"We live in a world of 'STEM supremacy'," says Alexandra Tavasoli @solistracorp. But the energy transition is an "across-the-board issue, and we need things like social science informed engineering decisions." https://t.co/A89bEsOm4U


24913022,Pembina,1443263488831344641,@ThatHeatherC says "do not fix the messenger, fix the problem." She says addressing systemic racism is the answer, not giving advice to racialized individuals.

Collecting race-based data is a first step she says we need to take to name the problems and address them. https://t.co/IY9lKhwuEA


24913022,Pembina,1443262640864653313,Have we seen meaningful action on the National Inquiry into #MMIWG?

@j_rdynburnouf says she does see change in that Indigenous women's voices are represented in the mainstream. But she says organizations still see the #TRC Calls to Action as optional, and that is not enough.


24913022,Pembina,1443261589801422851,How can we help women shift into areas of the #energy sector they are underrepresented in (e.g. technical roles)?

@j_rdynburnouf calls for systematic change, and doing more than one-off diversity initiatives. "We need to build new foundations that work for everyone." https://t.co/UYgp4EVTLT


24913022,Pembina,1443259601017663488,@KehkashanBasu says unconscious bias also leads people to call on men more often than women for technical answers, and that is something we can all challenge our own assumptions and internal biases on. https://t.co/afzOkSWXB2


24913022,Pembina,1443258758935683074,@j_rdynburnouf What can people do today to help increase representation of women in their organizations?

Alexandra Tavasoli @solistracorp says "speak out about it." She advises if you notice you're in a room with no other women, note that to your team &amp; let them know it concerns you. https://t.co/TojxDKO3OZ


24913022,Pembina,1443257810989436930,She says we need to be preparing women for roles at the executive levels, and socializing them young to dream big.

24913022,Pembina,1443250471196520458,@KehkashanBasu says that the lack of representation of women in leadership in the #CleanEnergy sector has motivated her to accelerate her own work. She says more education is needed for "more women to take their rightful place in the clean energy sector."


24913022,Pembina,1443249422041681923,@KehkashanBasu says her organization "uses clean energy as a tool for social equity." For example, provision of resources like solar powered cookers helps to reduce harmful fumes in homes and allows women &amp; girls to invest more time in their education and careers. https://t.co/lWClCmXZ3F

24913022,Pembina,1443245389100974082,@GLOBE_Series @cenovus @NRCan @Enbridge @CapitalPower Why are we using the term transformation instead of transition? Because Canada faces the challenge of not just moving from an ‚Äúold‚Äù energy system to a ‚Äúnew‚Äù one; the journey to a #NetZero future also requires reshaping the way #energy is produced, transported and consumed.
